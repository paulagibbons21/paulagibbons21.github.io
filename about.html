<!-- information about the chains around underrepresented minorities-->

<main>

	<p> Minorities and underrepresented communities collectively make up about 33% of the total STEM workforce. Though that
		seems like a pretty good number, it looks quite different when we break it down by ethnicity. Black workers only make up
		9% of STEM jobs, Hispanics take 8%, Asians, 13%, and others take the last 3%. Why are these such small percentages you
		may ask? Well, it goes all the way back to elementary and secondary education. Students in low-income communities and poorer
		schools have less access to science labs, materials, and activities. Change the Equation found that only about 47% of fourth-grade
		students in low-income schools in 2015 participated in hands-on science activities at least once per week. These students
		are missing out on important opportunities to develop an interest in STEM and thus are significantly less likely to pursue
		a STEM degree and career in the future. Therefore, their potential aptitude for STEM or their "inner genius" remains locked away because of those missed opportunities. Quotes gathered by the Pew Research Center bring to light what should be done to
		increase diversity and inclusion. <p class="quoteText"> “By encouraging these fields in early education and making available
			mentors, tutoring, and opportunities to experience various fields early on in education. Also when people, especially
			children, see themselves reflected in the world around them they tend to pursue various opportunities in education and
			employment as they become adults. Having a government that believes in science and technology and budgets monies (sic)
			to encourage growth and development in these fields.”</p>
		<p class="quoteText"> -Hispanic woman, nurse, 68</p>
		<p class="quoteText">“You must introduce those fields early in the elementary school years. Then continue to build on that
			by establishing STEM clubs and activities. Provide information to parents about local/community STEM events for continued
			interests. Most of all, make sure that any STEM student has the rigorous preparation that will be needed to get them accepted
			into college and able to handle the nature of the college-level classes.”</p>
		<p class="quoteText"> -Black woman, nurse, 49 </p>
		<p>Following these apt suggestions, there are many organizations that are working to introduce low-income and underrepresented
			students to STEM through various means. By supporting these organizations, we can start a trend for the better.
